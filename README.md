# Farm Animal ELL Learner Game
Update: ![image](https://github.com/zenagrams/animalworld/assets/110210132/155d0ab5-8f55-4f0e-be5b-fae7bc92a4fd)

I created this into a score counting game for fun. People can hear the animal sounds by clicking on image or using the keyboard. Full Spanish and English versions available by clicking the corresponding buttons!

## Key TakeAways
-The last debugging on this project was that the Spanish version wasn't keeping score. It was as simple as adding the second condition on all my functions! 

* if (currentAnimal === 'Horse'|| currentAnimal === 'El Caballo') 

-Console tool on the browser is my best friend. It helped me find the media queries needed to make my design responsive. The biggest hurdle for responsiveness was my aside. 

* At 700px I switched flex-direction. At 500px I used grid layout 

### Leaving this first read.me draft for reference:
This project is my first Javascript project. To allow people to hear animal sounds with keyboard strokes.
